Future of the project
=====================
Amazon abandoned the Amazon-dash buttons in early 2019. Since 2020 your buttons can be
bricked in an update from Amazon servers. To continue using your buttons you must configure your
router to block Internet connections from the buttons. Go to :ref:`block_connections` for more
information.

This project **will continue** to keep the Amazon dash buttons alive. However, we are looking for
alternatives. If you have suggestions you are welcome `to open an incident <https://github
.com/Nekmo/amazon-dash/issues>`_.

Amazon-dash includes :ref:`a command to change the Wi-Fi configuration <configure_wifi>` of your device.
It also includes :ref:`a command to hack devices <hack>` that have never connected to the Internet.

After configuring the Wifi you can use this project to do many actions with your buttons such as
:ref:`executing commands <execute_cmd>` on your system, :ref:`IFTT routines <iftt>`,
:ref:`Home Assistant <homeassistant>` and :ref:`more <configure_file>`.
